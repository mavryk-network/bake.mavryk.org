[{"body":"Preparation Installing TezBake CLI and using it to setup your Tezos baker is very simple. You will need the following tools:\nSpare computer or existing computer with Linux installed. We recommend Ubuntu Linux. (note: you must have an SSD drive or better \u0026 at least 8GB RAM) Ledger Nano S hardware wallet with Tezos Wallet \u0026 Baker apps installed. (note: it’s necessary to use Ledger Live to install the Tezos Wallet \u0026 Baking applications; to install the latter you must enable developer mode in Ledger Live settings) Installation Download and copy tezbake To begin, download the latest tezbake version for your Linux desktop and copy it to a universally available location so you can execute tezbake command from any location. Using the commands below, typed or pasted one-by-one is the intended order of operations. If you have a regular Intel or AMD computer that’s not “ARM” based.\ncd /tmp \u0026\u0026 wget https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbake-releases/raw/main/tezbake-linux-amd64 \u0026\u0026 chmod +x tezbake-linux-amd64 sudo mv tezbake-linux-amd64 /usr/sbin/tezbake # you may be prompted for sudo password; execute 1 line at a time If you have a Raspberry Pi or you’re running Linux on macOS M1 architecture:\ncd /tmp \u0026\u0026 wget https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbake-releases/raw/main/tezbake-linux-arm64 \u0026\u0026 chmod +x tezbake-linux-arm64 sudo mv tezbake-linux-arm64 /usr/sbin/tezbake # you may be prompted for sudo password; execute 1 line at a time Setup Tezos node, signer and install tezbake dependencies tezbake setup -a # you may be prompted for sudo password Bootstrap Tezos node At this stage, it’s necessary to bootstrap your node, meaning to download a copy of the blockchain so you don’t have to synchronize block-by-block, which takes hours at best. With the import method shown below, bootstrapping could take as little as 5 minutes.\ntezbake bootstrap-node --tarball Start Tezos node After importing the snapshot, you need to start your node and wait until it’s fully synchronized before importing your Ledger key.\ntezbake start After starting the node, run the following command over and over every few minutes and monitor the “level” displayed.\ntezbake info Level refers to the latest block number on mainnet. Navigate to https://tzkt.io or https://tzstats.com and observe the latest block. Once the level in your command matches the latest block on your blockchain explorer, your node is in full sync and you can keep following the steps below.\nImport Ledger key Now that your node is in full sync, you can import your Ledger key. You will need to connect your Ledger and enter your Ledger PIN. Then open the Tezos Baking app.\ntezbake import-key --derivation-path=\"ed25519/0h/0h\" # If you have a custom derivation path, you can change ed to bip as shown (--derivation-path=\"bip25519/3h/6h/9h\") The ledger will ask you twice to confirm this operation. Make sure the baker you see on the ledger screen matches the one you want to use. If you don’t have this information yet, don’t worry. To get the address of the ledger that’s used by default simply go to https://kukai.app and login with ledger, accepting the default derivation path.\nbip is supposed to be more strong in the long term than ed25519, which is the default one. Including it in the command above as shown does not change the default behavior but it shows which path is default so it can be customized for preference and security.\nPutting the baker on a non-default derivation path provides an additional layer of security for your baker at the cost of extra complexity for you. Make sure your setup is clearly documented for your own records.\nAuthorize Ledger to bake for key Having imported your Ledger key to your signer, it’s time to authorize your Ledger to bake for this key.\ntezbake setup-ledger --main-hwm 1 # Pay careful attention to the value of --main-hwm If your device was used to bake before it might have a “high watermark” aka HWM. If you try to use this device on a testnet, it will not work because the block height on test networks usually starts with 1 while mainnet is up to over a couple of million blocks at the time of writing. If you used to bake on mainnet with the same ledger as you’re trying to use now but it’s been a while, it’s highly recommended to change the 1 above to the current Tezos block, which can be found at.\nThe watermark is simply a record of the lack block number your ledger helped to bake or endorse. If you’re setting up a brand new device that’s not been used for baking before, there is no need to alter the default command above.\nAlways make sure you’re not accidentally going to double bake by using your production ledger and/or setup to bake on a testnet. It’s really easy to make this mistake and the only thing preventing it are your personal standard operating procedures.\nRegister Ledger key as baker on the blockchain For this step your node level must be synced with the latest block on the blockchain explorer. You must also temporarily open your Ledger Tezos Wallet app to register your key as a baker. For all other operations, you must use the Tezos Baking app.\ntezbake register-key Registering is not necessary if this is already an active baker ledger which is being setup on some kind of failover machine or in a situation where it has not been over 2 weeks of actively baking.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

A note on the Private-key file - it is not recommended to use an existing wallet that may house important assets (including NFT’s or crypto tokens) but to create a new wallet that contains only enough Tezos to pay out delegates.\nPreparation: Step 2 Download Files Download the software from Github using the link: https://github.com/alis-is/tezpay/releases. In this repository, select the correct operating system and system architecture (arm64 or amd64). For this example we will be using arm64\nNote: If you do not know the system architecture you can find out by opening a Terminal and executing the command uname -m, and this will return the system architecturearm64 or amd64.\nThe example below displays arm64\nIf you would rather utilize CLI to download the application you will need to change directory (cd) to the TezPay directory created in step 1 in the terminal, then use command wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alis-is/tezpay/main/install.sh -O /tmp/install.sh \u0026\u0026 sh /tmp/install.sh\nSee example code below (note: input begins after last ‘%’ character):\nThe above example is an alternative to downloading from the GitHub repository\nNext, you will download the sample configuration file \u0026 payout_wallet_private.sample.key file from : https://github.com/alis-is/tezpay/blob/main/docs/configuration/ - or you can open file in GitHub and copy text to a text editor.\nNote, there are two choices for the configuration files:\nSimple Config file : config.default.hjson (basic arguments to run Tezpay) Full Config: config.sample.hjson (advanced arguements to run Tezpay) Preparation: Step 3 - Payout Wallet (optional) Lastly, you will need to download the create a new wallet and retrieve the private key. We will be using the Temple Wallet extension to create a new wallet and to get the private key. If you already have a payout wallet, or know how, skip this section.\nFirst, open Temple Wallet and select the icon in upper right Next, select ’new account’, and input a new (ie Tezpay1) Then, click the icon in the upper right again Then, go to Settings Then, go to Reveal Private Key Then, you will be prompt to input your password for the account Your private key will be displayed here:\nSetup The next section will review the setup needed for Tezpay. We will review the Configuration File and Payout Wallet files. In this section we will review:\nConfiguration File (simple) Configuration File (advanced) Private-Key File Setup: Step 1a: Configuration File (simple) This section will review how to setup the configuration file (simple-version) to be used by the TezPay application.\n*Note: must have file name config.hjson, case-sensitive *\nYellow is areas you will input data/edit fields\nBlue are comments about Configuration File objects\nPaste your Baker wallet in between the quotes Set your Baker fee (ie 0.05 = 5% fee) Input minimum payout for delegators (ie. 1 = 1 XTZ) This section allows you to split payments for baking (Bonds) and fees from delegators (Fees) if you want - input Baker wallet address and percentage to split. This example does not split, where 1=100% to baker wallet. This section refers to network parameters to fetch information about the baker in order to compile rewards and payouts - Do not edit unless you are an experienced user Over delegation projection prohibits you from over paying beyond your delegation limit - Do not edit unless you are an experience user This is as basic configuration file for running the TezPay application. The next section will review the advanced configuration file, giving more options and customization to the TezPay application. A user may splice sections from the advanced file to the simple to build a custom file as well - but should be done by experienced users.\nSetup: Step 1b: Configuration File (advanced) This section will review how to setup the configuration file (advanced-version) to be used by the TezPay application.\n*Note: must have file name config.hjson, case-sensitive *\nYellow is areas you will input data/edit fields Blue are comments about Configuration File objects\nPaste your Baker wallet in between the quotes Set your Baker fee (ie 5% = 0.05) Input minimum payout for delegators (ie. 1 = 1 XTZ) Input minimum staking balance for delegators Input delegators wallets that you wish to ignore completely (not often used) Overrides: These will override global settings for delegators - you may delete/remove specific fields where you want to ignore Input wallet address for specific delegator you wish to apply overrides for Input a delegator-specific custom fee (ie 0.5% = 0.005) Input either true or false where true removes the fee from delegator, and false applies the fee specified in the line above Input minimum balance override for specified wallet\\ If you wish to add multiple wallets for over rides, add another wallet following same format keeping the { } to contain the wallet attribute as shown. This section allows you to split payments for baking (Bonds), input wallet address and percentage to allocate (see example above for structure of more than 1 wallet. 100%=1.00 This section allows you to split payments for fees collected (Fees), input wallet address and percentage to allocate (see example above for structure of more than 1 wallet. 100%=1.00 Donations refer to donating a specific amount of XTZ to wallets every payout Input a donation amount in donate field as a percentage (ie 2.5% = 0.025) Input wallets that you wish to donate to and percentage for each (ie 100% = 1.0) This section refers to network parameters to fetch information about the baker in order to compile rewards and payouts Do not edit unless you are an experienced user Over delegation projection prohibits you from over paying beyond your delegation limit Do not edit unless you are an experience user This section allows for automatic notifications/messages to be sent to specific platforms in order to broadcast messages (ie ‘Bakery has paid 100XTZ in rewards for latest cycle’ We will cover this in a separate section see appendix X and platforms supported are Twitter, Discord, and E-mail Setup: Step 2: Private-Key File The Private Key file is used to sign the transaction(s) that will payout the rewards. From a security perspective, it is recommended NOT to use the Baker private key due to security concerns with the private key being displayed in plain-text in a file. This section will use the new account and private-key that was acquired in Step 3 - Payout Wallet.\nRetrieve the private-key of the wallet you wish to use from the payout wallet of your choice Paste into a text file (or replace the example that was downloaded from the GitHub repository Save the file with exact file name and extension payout_wallet_private.key - note: the .key is required in this instance (see below) Setup: Summary At this point there should be 3 files in the directory tezpay. These three files will be used to run the application and payouts.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

Briefly, the proposal process is as follows:\nProposal. If no proposal gets more than 5% of the state to vote for it, the proposal process repeats indefinitely. As soon as a proposal gets 5% of the state to vote for it, the proposal process moves to the next stage. In cases where there are multiple 5%+ proposals on the table, the proposal with the most votes wins. Exploration Proposal needs to hit quorum (around 50% of all stake voting in some way) and it needs to further hit an acceptance level of 80%+. If it fails to meet these thresholds, the process resets back to the Proposal stage. Cooldown The proposal is tested on a dedicated test network to make sure it migrates and runs. Dapp developers make sure this proposal doesn’t break their dapps. Promotion Proposal needs to hit quorum (around 50% of all stake voting in some way) and it needs to further hit an acceptance level of 80%+. If it fails to meet these thresholds, the process resets back to the Proposal stage. Adoption The proposal is officially accepted and goes into effect at the end of the Adoption stage. The Ghostnet test network is upgraded as a final test before Mainnet adoption. Dapp developers make sure this proposal doesn’t break their dapps and make any necessary changes to their dapps. We recommend you read more about the Tezos Voting process here: https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/voting.html\nProposal voting with TezGov TezGov allows you to participate in Tezos proposal voting with your Ledger hardware wallet.\nWe recommend using a secondary Ledger device with the same seed, to vote with while your primary device is baking. You can also briefly unplug your primary Ledger baking device and use it on a different computer just for voting purposes (use the wallet app to vote), then immediately plugging it back into the primary device, opening the baking app and resuming baking only. If your baking computer itself has a graphical interface, you can briefly switch to the wallet app on your Ledger device and vote, then switch back to the baking app and resume baking only. In order to vote using your Ledger device, you must have the Tezos wallet app installed and open on your Ledger device. If you have the baking app open, you will not be able to vote\nTezGov Web Portal TezGov Web Portal: https://gov.tez.capital\nLog into the TezGov portal by using the most secure method available to you.\nWe highly recommend using the direct Ledger login at the top. This method allows you to see the specific details of your vote on your Ledger screen. Use the Remote (signer) method if you have a signer somewhere on your LAN or local computer. This is an option for advanced users. Use the Beacon method if you are using a Beacon enabled wallet like Temple or Kukai. In this case you will not see the exact details of your vote on your Ledger screen and you will instead be asked to sign an arbitrary blob message. This method also works fine but it is inherently less secure than the direct Ledger method Once logged in you’ll see the TezGov home screen. You can see the current cycle, the current proposal, the current voting period, and the current voting period progress. You can also see the current proposal status and the current proposal details.\nExploration and Promotion Periods During the exploration and promotion periods you will see the period name Exploration or Promotion in the middle of the page. You can vote for the current proposal by clicking the NAY, PASS or YAY buttons.\nYou will be asked to confirm the vote on your Ledger device.\nOnce confirmed, the page will refresh within 30 seconds.\nAfter finished, you’ll be able to click on the confirmation link for your vote.\nCooldown Period During the cooldown period you will period name Cooldown in the middle of the page and you will not be able to vote until the next period.

Baking is suited for individuals at home as well as companies in their on-premise data centers, and cloud providers.\nAt this time the TezBake software focuses on indivudals and companies baking on premise in their homes and own data centers. We do not support baking on cloud providers at this time. We support the most secure on-premise baking method which involves dedicating a small form factor computer to baking with a Ledger Nano S or Nano S Plus hardware wallet as the key storage device. This setup is inexpensive, widely available, and very secure. It does not require a very fast internet connection. It is also very easy to setup and maintain wit TezBake.\nThere is never any stake slashing on Tezos in the event of a hardware failure. You will merely not receive rewards for the period of time that the baking computer is down.\nAll blocks that you must bake are scheduled around 15 days in advance.

This is much faster than synchronizing the blockchain from scratch. There is a way to quickly bootstrap your node using a snapshot and a way to bootstrap your node using a snapshot and a block hash. The latter is the most reliable and robust method but it is also the slowest. The former is faster but it assumes you trust the source of the snapshot.\nPlease be aware that bootstrapping your node could result in your nonce revelation to fail and for you to forfit your endorsement rights for the cycle. This is because by default we’re using rolling snapshots which don’t export full blocks for past cycles by default. If your node baked a special kind of block during the lack cycle, it may be asked to provide its nonce to the network. To do so, it needs to have the .tezos-client data intact from the last cycle and it needs to have the full blocks for the last cycle.\nTo remedy this situation and to never risk forfitting your endorsement rights for a whole cycle, you have to use a snapshot that’s at least 5-6 days old (from today), when bootstrapping a node. You also have to not wipe out or to move your .tezos-client directory. This way you’ll always have at least 1 cycle+ of full blocks in your node’s database as well as the nonce file on disk. The downside of this method is that it will slow down your bootstrap process by the amount of time it takes to download the full blocks for the past 1 cycle+, which can be up to 2 hours on some slow home networks.\nBootstrap using a snapshot You can get Tezos node snapshots in the following places run by the Tezos Foundation and Marigold respectively:\nhttps://snapshots.tzinit.org/ https://snapshot-api.tezos.marigold.dev/mainnet Before bootstrapping your node, made sure to stop your node as shown below.\nUsing the first bootstrap method below ensures that the snapshot is checked for consistency both programmatically and by your checking the blockchain explorer(s) to confirm the block hash. This is the most reliable and robust method but it it also the slowest.\ntezbake stop tezbake bootstrap-node \u003curl\u003e \u003cblock_hash\u003e tezbake start # example: tezbake bootstrap-node https://snapshots.eu.tzinit.org/mainnet/rolling BL8Vq12HX6MJWkB6RLgQAYRKpKZ5fyMoLpWzAoQ6mh55gkKHiQU You can replace eu above with us or asia if you prefer to use a different mirror closer to you.\nThe \u003cblock_hash\u003e argument is optional but encouraged. If you don’t want to borther with this protection, use the second method below which will also be faster.\nVerify the hash/checksum provided by the snapshot provider to ensure the snapshot is valid. You can find the correct hashes for all blocks on Tezos blockchain explorers such as: https://tzkt.io/blocks https://tzstats.com/\nSimply search for the block number in the search field and verify the hash of the block matches the hash provided by the snapshot provider.\nUsing the second bootstrap method below is faster but it assumes you trust the source of the snapshot. Sometimes one doesn’t have a choice and must make such trade-offs when time is of the essence.\ntezbake stop tezbake bootstrap-node --no-check \u003curl\u003e tezbake start # example: tezbake bootstrap-node --no-check https://snapshots.eu.tzinit.org/mainnet/rolling You can replace eu above with us or asia if you prefer to use a different mirror closer to you.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

Since the Tezos protocol block time has been reduced to 15 seconds, bakers have had to migrate from the Ledger Nano S, to the faster Nano S Plus devices and even the Nano X’s. Unfortunately, this means their Ledger devices are now susceptible to screen burn in and burn out, before an official Ledger Live patch for this issue is released.\nWe have developed an internal fix to the screen blanking issue which we eventually made public, so that other bakers can benefit from it as well. We are now recommending side loading our fix on all Ledger Nano S Plus devices in order to preserve our baker Ledger screens while we try to convince the Ledger organization to include our fix in their official Ledger Live release. There is currently no way of knowing how long this will take.\nThe patch described below is a temporary fix for this issue, until Ledger Live releases an official patch. We do not recommend side loading Ledger apps in general but this is a necessary evil for the time being if bakers want to preserve their device screens. We need everyone’s help to gently encourage Ledger to include the fix in their official Ledger Live release.\nUnfortunately, the patch is not currently loadable on the Ledger Nano X because it doesn’t allow app side loading by design. This patch is also not to be used on the regular Ledger Nano S because the official firmware properly handles the screen blanking. Once Ledger officially releases our patch, it will work seamlessly on all Ledger Nano devices.\nThe source code can be found here: https://github.com/alis-is/app-tezos/tree/baking-burn-in-protection\nThe patch has been reviewed by several highly skilled engineers and has been used by a few bakers over the period of a few months without any issues.\nPatch Side Loading Instructions Install Prerequisites You’ll need to manually delete your old Tezos Baking app using Ledger Live, before you can side load the patched app. You’ll also need to install docker and add your current user to the docker group.\nsudo apt update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt install docker.io -y sudo usermod -aG docker $USER Reboot after this step.\nTo use the patched app, you will need to update your Ledger Nano S Plus to Ledger firmware version 1.1.0+ https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4445777839901-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-Plus-firmware\nAfter finishing this step, ensure you do not have Ledger Live running when trying to perform the rest of the steps or while trying to bake.\nInstall Patched App (version 2.3.3) on Ledger Nano Plus Side loading the patch is a simple process, but it does require a few steps. Please follow the instructions below carefully.\ncd ~ git clone https://github.com/alis-is/app-tezos.git cd app-tezos git checkout baking-burn-in-protection docker run --privileged --rm -ti -v \"$(realpath .):/app\" ghcr.io/ledgerhq/ledger-app-builder/ledger-app-builder-lite:latest BOLOS_SDK=/opt/nanosplus-secure-sdk APP=tezos_baking TARGET_NAME=nanos2 make load After running the BOLOS_SDK command, your Ledger Nano Plus will display a message asking you to confirm the installation of the app. Press both buttons to confirm the installation.\nWhen starting the app for the first time, you will be asked to confirm the execution of the app. Press both buttons to confirm. This is because the app is not published by Ledger.\nSetup baker again After uninstallin the old app and installing the new one (2.3.3), you will need to setup your Ledger Nano S Plus for baking again.\nPlug in Ledger, input pin, open patched Tezos Baking app, and then run the following command:\ntezbake setup-ledger --main-hwm 3826854 Replace 3826854 with the latest current head block height. You can find this information on tzstats.com.\nConfirm the operation on your Ledger device and you’re done!\nBlanking out Ledger Nano S Plus Screen Plug in Ledger Nano S Plus Input pin Open patched Tezos Baking app (accept warning) Hit the left button until you see Application is ready Hit both buttons to blank out screen The screen will also blank out when you perform your first attestation (i.e. endorsement) of a block.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

This is an option for advanced users. Use the Beacon method if you are using a Beacon enabled wallet like Temple or Kukai. In this case you will not see the exact details of your vote on your Ledger screen and you will instead be asked to sign an arbitrary blob message. This method also works fine but it is inherently less secure than the direct Ledger method. Click New Proposal\nYou have 2 options when submitting a proposal via the TezGov portal.\n(1) You can submit a proposal published by the Tezos core developers by pasting its hash The true names of the proposals crafted by the collective Tezos core developer teams are posted in https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/blog.html. Any Tezos baker can submit these proposals to the Tezos blockchain by pasting their hash as shown below. In the example given, the baker is submitting the Nairobi proposal.\n(2) You can submit a message to the Tezos bakers and community in the form of a Tezos proposal hash Vanity names are names crafted for the sole purpose to send a message to all ecosystem participants. They are not meant to be passed during the exploration or adoption phases. Vanity proposals are meant to be used as a way to communicate with the whole Tezos community as a delegate (i.e. baker) on Tezos. In the example given, the baker is submitting a signal that on-chain funding is something desirable.\nVanity proposals can be used for other reasons as well but they are never meant to be pursued all the way through. The scope of vanity proposals does not extend past the proposal round. All bakers must take great care not to vote on these proposals once the governance process enters the exploration phase.\nWe encourage all bakers to use this system only for serious ecosystem governance issues. The governance portal functionality is a two way street. The ability to speak does not absolve a baker from the consequences of the baker’s speech.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

The text are configured in the config.json file, however there are preliminary steps needed inorder to be able to utilize these features. This section will review the necessary steps and information needed from platforms that allow for auto-notifications sent via TezPay. **This tutorial is meant for individuals that have zero experience with interacting with these systems - feel free to skip sections if you are an advanced user.** Twitter A Baker can use TezPay to automatically send notifications that payments have been made. This allows for ease of communications for the public baker to the delegates and we will walk through steps to allow for this here. There will be two sections: 1. Twitter Setup 2. TezPay config.json file setup Twitter Setup In order to setup twitter, be sure you are signed in on a browser window to your twitter account. While being signed into Twitter in a seperate browser, navigate to https://developer.twitter.com/ and select ‘Developer Portal’ in the top menu- the developer portal site where you will set up your development account and get the required information for the config.json file and set up permissions. You will then need to fill in some basic information in order to enable the Development Portal profile to be active. be sure that all of the information is correct (if you use multiple twitter accounts be sure the one you want to enable for notifications is the correct one). Once you submit the information for your development profile - you will need to accept the Terms and Conditions. After accepting Terms and Conditions - you will need to verify your e-mail address that you provided by clicking the link in the e-mail sent from Twitter. Once you verify your email - this will automatically link you back to your Developer Portal Site and prompt you for an ‘App Name’ (see TezPay Notif in screen capture). Once you name your App - you will be given 3 seperate Keys. These will be used to inorder to call the Twitter profile that you are looking to send Notifcations to - and sign for the permissions. Be sure to have these saved in a secure place - they will be used later. Once you have the keys secured, click ‘Dashboard’ button in lower right. You will now be in your Twitter Development Dashboard and see the App you created (for this example TezPayNotifs). Click the ‘gear’ icon to continue set-up. Navigate to ‘User Authentication Settings’ section and click ‘Set-up’ to continue. We will fill out the required items for the form under User Authentication settings as follows: i. App Permissions: Select ‘Read and write’ ii. Type of App: Select ‘Web App, Automated App or Bot’\niii. App Info: a. Callback URI/Redirect URL: this can be anything but for this example we will use ‘https://www.TezPayisthebest.com/'\nb. Website URL: this can be anything but for this example we will use ‘https://www.TezPayisthebest.com/'\niv. Click ‘save’ when finished. You will then get your Client ID and Client Secret - copy and save both of these with your other Keys attained earlier. Click ‘Done’\nThis will bring you back to the main screen of the App - navigate to the ‘Keys and Tokens’ toggle at the top of the page. Now, ‘Generate’ an Access Token and secret - write these down and then once you have confirmed you will be ready to edit the config.json in TezPay. Note - be sure the Access Token and Secret has ‘read and write’ permission (see image below). For the Next step - setting up the config.json - you will need four items:\na. API Key and Secret (also known as Consumer Key/Secret)\nb. Access Token and Secret TezPay config.json Setup for Twitter Notifications We will use the API Key and Secret as well as the Access Token and Secret to edit the Config file to allow for permissions and calls to push notifcations upon each successful payout.\nYou will add the following code block at the base of the config.json file to enable the notifications for TezPay. Note that the message_template can be anything and you can use the , , terms to automatically fill in these terms for each cycle. notifications: [\n{\naccess_token: Your_Acces_Token\naccess_token_secret: Your_Access_Token_Secret\nconsumer_key: Your_Consumer_Key\nconsumer_secret: Your_Consumer_Key_Secret\nmessage_template: Rewards for \u003cCycle\u003e have been paid to \u003cDelegators\u003e delegates in amount of \u003cDistributedRewards\u003e using #TezPay.👀 XTZ baked with #TezBake!

We will sometimes specify which upgrade method to use by referencing its letter. If a letter recommendation is not specified, use the guidelines below to determine which method to use:\n(A) This upgrade method works in most cases. The only component not updated is the tezbake binary itself. (B) This upgrade method is used when you want to update the Octez binaries only. This is useful when old protocol binaries need to be removed from your baker. (C) This upgrade method is used when you want to update the entire TezBake stack. If you have the time, this is the recommended method as it makes sure you get the latest version of all components. (D) This upgrade method is used when you want to update the tezbake binary only. Sometimes we release new versions of tezbake that have fixes and new features to make your baker setup and operation easier. This upgrade method doesn’t take your baker down as the tezbake binary is not used during the baking process. (A) Update ami \u0026 eli and Octez binaries (updates components: #1, #2, #4)\ntezbake upgrade -a (B) Update Octez binaries only (updates components: #4)\ntezbake upgrade (C) Update the entire TezBake stack (updates components: #1, #2, #3, #4)\nFirst update your tezbake binary to the latest version, depending on your computer architecture:\n# If you have a regular Intel or AMD computer that's not \"ARM\" based: cd /tmp \u0026\u0026 wget https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbake-releases/raw/main/tezbake-linux-amd64 \u0026\u0026 chmod +x tezbake-linux-amd64 sudo mv tezbake-linux-amd64 /usr/sbin/tezbake # you may be prompted for sudo password # If you have an ARM based computer such as a Raspberry Pi: cd /tmp \u0026\u0026 wget https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbake-releases/raw/main/tezbake-linux-arm64 \u0026\u0026 chmod +x tezbake-linux-arm64 sudo mv tezbake-linux-arm64 /usr/sbin/tezbake # you may be prompted for sudo password Then update the rest of the TezBake software stack:\ntezbake upgrade -a (D) Update tezbake only (updates components: #3)\nUpdate your tezbake binary to the latest version, depending on your computer architecture:\n# If you have a regular Intel or AMD computer that's not \"ARM\" based: cd /tmp \u0026\u0026 wget https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbake-releases/raw/main/tezbake-linux-amd64 \u0026\u0026 chmod +x tezbake-linux-amd64 sudo mv tezbake-linux-amd64 /usr/sbin/tezbake # you may be prompted for sudo password # If you have an ARM based computer such as a Raspberry Pi: cd /tmp \u0026\u0026 wget https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbake-releases/raw/main/tezbake-linux-arm64 \u0026\u0026 chmod +x tezbake-linux-arm64 sudo mv tezbake-linux-arm64 /usr/sbin/tezbake # you may be prompted for sudo password What should I do after updating? After all updates and changes to your Tezos node, always ensure your baking process continues successfully by monitoring its performance on https://TzStats.com and https://TzKT.io.\nCheck your TezBake stack versions to ensure they are up to date:\ntezbake version --all You should see the expected Octez version along with the release date of the binaries.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

One computer will be used for baking and the other computer will be used as a backup. A manual failover of the Ledger hardware will be necessary to start baking on the second computer if the first computer fails. The second computer is optional, but it is highly recommended. If you only have one computer, you will need to have a backup plan in place in case the computer fails.\nTwo Ledger Nano S or Nano S Plus While having two computers is somewhat optional, especially for a smaller baker, having two Ledger Nano S or Nano S Plus hardware wallets is very highly recommended. You will need to have two hardware wallets for the following reasons:\nIn the event of Ledger hardware failure To transfer tez to your payment wallet or elsewhere, without interrupting baking To vote on Tezos governance proposals, without interrupting baking Note that you must never simultanerously use two hardware wallets to bake for the same baking address. This will result in a double baking or double endorsing offense and you will be slashed. It’s very easy to avoid by:\nNot authorizing the second hardware wallet to bake for the same address before it’s needed Not importing your baking wallet into your backup computer before it’s needed Before changing any Ledger connections, always ensuring that only one hardware wallet is baking for the address Not installing TezBake on second computer before it’s needed. If you have a fast internet connection, the entire setup process takes just a few minutes. If you only have one hardware wallet and it fails, you will be down until you get a second one and set it up to bake.\nOne UPS battery backup Having at least one UPS device which has your ISP connection and your baking computer connected to it is highly recommended. This will ensure that your baking computer will not be interrupted in the event of electrical failure up to the amount of time supported by your battery. The bigger the battery, the more time your computer will keep baking when power fails.\nIf your baking computer and your ISP are in different rooms or on different electrical outlets, you need to ensure that each one is independently supplied with UPS power.\nBad Practices Using Wi-Fi Using DHCP Using your daily use computer or laptop Not using TezBake Discord or Telegram monitoring bots Using Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is not as realiable as a wired connection and can cause strange and random issues. It is highly recommended that you use a wired connection for your baking computer.\nUsing DHCP DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to your computer. This can cause issues with your baking computer in the event where DHCP is unable to automatically renew its lease. It is highly recommended that you use a static IP address for your baking computer.\nUsing your daily use computer or laptop If you use your daily computer for baking, it’s much more likely to have issues because of accidentally affecting either your baker’s connection to the internet or your Ledger’s connection to your baker.\nNot using TezBake Discord or Telegram monitoring bots The TezBake Discord and Telegram bots are designed to monitor your baker’s status and alert you if there are any issues. It is highly recommended that you use these bots to monitor your baker. Should your baker go offline, you will be notified immediately and can take action to fix the issue.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

The only difference is that a public baker has announced themselves to the Tezos community and is willing to accept delegations. A private baker is not willing to accept delegations from delegators. A private baker cannot stop these delegations from occuring but a private baker is not expected to pay out rewards to delegators.\nOn Tezos, bakers (a.k.a. delegates) are paid directly by the blockchain for themselves as well as for their delegators. It’s up to each and every baker to determine their own fee structure and payment policies. It’s also up to each baker as to which payment software they will use to distribute rewards to delegators. There are several different payment software options available to bakers. Some bakers use their own custom software, some bakers use a third party payment software, and some bakers use a combination of both. We recommend using our TezPay payment software. TezPay allows you to fully automate the distribution of rewards to delegators.\nA public baker has to contact two entities within the Tezos ecosystem to be added to the list of public bakers within each of their ecosystems. The entities in question all have their own methods to determine your public baker details, such as your fee and payment policies, via self-reporting. You will be asked to self-report your details to each of the following entities:\nhttps://tzstats.com (BlockWatch) The best place to contact them is: tzstats@blockwatch.cc https://tzkt.io / https://baking-bad.org (Baking Bad) The best place to contact them is: https://t.me/baking_bad_chat Most wallets and services on Tezos pull their baker information from one of these sources.\nYou also have the option of contacting the folks at Ledger directly in order to be listed as a baker on their Ledger Live wallet. You can contact them via the following link: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

Fundamentally speaking, “Baking” on Tezos involves 2 things:\nThe creation of blocks every 15 seconds as well as the attestation of the soundness of blocks produced by other bakers. Bakers put their tez at stake in order to be able to bake blocks and attest other bakers’ blocks. The tez put at stake by the bakers is used as deterrent against bakers acting maliciously. If a baker acts maliciously, they will lose their tez at stake. If a baker acts honestly, they will be rewarded with tez from the protocol. To act maliciously, a baker would have to create a block that is invalid or attest to a block that is invalid.\nParticipating in the Tezos proposal governance process.
